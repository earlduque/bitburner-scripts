# bitburner-scripts

Just my script files for [BitBurner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/). Most are .script but I've saved them here as .js so that the color-formatting triggers.

- [refresh.script](/refresh.js) is the starting point
  - it nukes then copies [early.script](/early.js) to all listed servers
  - and then runs [post-refresh.script](/post-refresh.js) on all moneyless servers
- [hacknet.script](/hacknet.js) buys the cheapest hacknet upgrades/purchase nodes until money runs out

I'm trying to not use any scripts from the community and make them on my own using only the docs
